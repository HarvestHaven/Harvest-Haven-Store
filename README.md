## What is this App?

The Harvest Haven App is a special website that can anyone can take with them whether you are on your computer, your tablet or phone. We chose not to go through the hurtles of mobile app development through Google and Apple and have put together something called a 'PWA', that allows us to share the same Harvest Haven experience with both desktop and mobile device users. It also makes it easier for us to keep the app updated and distributed for all. We hope you like it!
